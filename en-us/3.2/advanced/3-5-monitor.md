# Monitoring

Compared to PHP developers, we deeply feel that developers are not easy. From development, operation and maintenance to troubleshooting and problem solving. That's why we've also integrated [ELK] (https://www.elastic.co/) into the business development framework as one of the ways to do this.

Use ELK can easily record our application log, can be distributed to a number of businesses unified recovery to a centralized analysis.

#### Environmental requirements:

* swoole> 1.9.9
* elasticsearch> = 5.0
* logstash> = 5.0
* kibana> = 5.0

#### renderings:

#### use

Set `app.php` log format library `\FastD\Logger\Formatter\StashFormatter::class`, the log can be unified processing to complete the configuration.

Example:
Â 
```php
<?php

return [
    // code ...
    'log' => [
        [
            \Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler::class,
            'info.log',
            \FastD\Logger\Logger::INFO,
            \FastD\Logger\Formatter\StashFormatter::class,
        ],
    ],
    // code ...
];
```

> Enable unified log collection processing Prerequisites The ELK log analysis system needs to be installed. Can refer to: [ELK Chinese Guide](https://kibana.logstash.es/content/logstash/get-start/install.html)

Open `logstash` to collect logs and push `bin/logstash -f path/to/log`

When done, you can access the business process and generate logs to test it.
