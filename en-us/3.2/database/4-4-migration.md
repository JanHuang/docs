# data migration

Version 3.2 provides a more complete data migration capabilities, since: [fastd/migration](https://github.com/JanHuang/migration) components

### basic use

The migration component provides easy-to-use command-line tools for quick access through the terminal window.

##### info command

This command lists all the tables in the existing database and displays them through the terminal

```php
$ php bin/console migrate info
```

By adding the table name, view the detailed data table structure.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate info table
```

##### dump command

The dump command is used to export the data table structure into a seed table structure that can be used to export the local database structure and then submit the code for use by others as the code is merged and updated.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate dump
```

Export the specified table structure

```php
$ php bin/console migrate dump table
```

##### seed

Create a seed seed file.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate seed table
```

The structure is created as follows:

```php
<?php

use \FastD\Migration\MigrationAbstract;
use \FastD\Migration\Table;


class {Table} extends MigrationAbstract
{
    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function setUp()
    {
        $table = new Table('hello');

        $table
            // some code
        ;

        return $table;
    }
}
```

##### run

Execute the seed file and automatically populate the data, the data can be used to pre-define the test data, which will help speed up application testing.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate run
```

Run the specified table.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate run table
```

Custom data sets stored in the dataset directory by default, can be adjusted by the `-d` parameter.

The program will automatically read the yml file name of the table to read, and then insert operation.

!> Each run of the program to perform a data filling, if you want to re-insert, execute the cache --clear command to clear the cache.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate run table -d /tmp
```

##### cache

Cache processing operations, used to view and clean up cached data, without affecting business processes.

```php
$ php bin/console migrate cache
```

clear cache

```php
$ php bin/console migrate cache --clear
```
